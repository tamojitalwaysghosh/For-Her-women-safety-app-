App Layout in details:


Home Screen:

The Home Screen helps you to get your “current location”, it also helps you to find the nearby “Police Stations”, “Hospitals”, “Pharmacy”, “Bus Stops” near your current location.
In case of emergency, you can access the speed dials for calling “Police”, “Ambulance”, “Fire Brigade”, “Disaster Management”.


SOS Screen:

In the SOS screen, add your trusted contacts locally inside the app. You can call them directly through the app.
Swipe the contacts tile to add or delete it. Add the contacts to send SOS message to them.
Android do not allow direct messaging through the app, so after pressing the “SEND” button the user would be directed to their default messaging app (along with their saved message, contacts, and current location (if enabled)) to send the message.
The user can choose if she/he wants to include their current location or not.
